# This is a database of all of my leetcode problems and solutions
**The reason for logging the problems here is:**
1. I get to program offline
2. I can mess around with the code a bit more
3. I can log my improvements and overall progress easier

**File Structure**
 - Programs will be sorted based off of number
 - The folder inside the problem number will be the date of completion
 - Numbers after date will be edits made on same date
 - The comments on the top will show "Beats xx.xx% of people"
